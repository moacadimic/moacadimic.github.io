I'm a 4th-year Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at Clemson University. I'm interested in policy compliance, security and privacy in voice/mobile ecosystems, Internet of Things, AI-for-security with large language and vision-language models, and privacy-preserving defenses for connected systems. I'm honored to work under the guidance of Dr. Long Cheng, whose expertise and mentorship have been invaluable to my work.

I welcome collaboration and would love to discuss any intriguing subjects. Don't hesitate to reach out to me at [mshujaa@clemson.edu](mailto:mshujaa@clemson.edu). I'm eager to learn from you.

## Research Focus
- Security & privacy compliance across mobile, voice assistant, and IoT platforms
- AI-driven security defenses with large language and vision-language models
- Privacy-preserving safeguards for connected and cyber-physical systems
